# more about this website
### june 20, 2024
If you're reading this, you've probably gone through the rest (or most) of my website.

The main reason I decided to create this website was that my previous one was a [dumpster fire](https://github.com/benjaminmah/personal-website). The entire website was built 
using a single HTML and CSS file. The CSS file contained over 1500 lines (1586 to be exact), and overall it was 
unresponsive and messy. It met my design standards, but I was unhappy with the overall structure of the codebase, 
which was held together almost like a house with duct tape.

So, I decided to start from scratch with a clear vision of what I wanted: minimalist and charming.

number 1: I had to include some sort of drawing (by me) and have it animated.

number 2: I needed a music player, similar to my old website.

number 3: I wanted to add a blog to add some more personality.

Regarding number 1, I decided to spend 10 minutes aimlessly drawing with my mouse on Microsoft Paint. The results?
Definitely not Picasso-level, but perfect for small icons (say hi to Froggy at the top of the page!). I drew 
two versions of each icon to give them that "animated" feel.

For number 2, I added a music play/pause feature (similar to my old website) and added a replay button so visitors can
replay the song as many times as they like. Plus, the music keeps playing no matter what page you're on! I hope 
you're listening to some music while reading this!

Finally, for number 3, I decided to implement a way to create blog posts using Markdown files, so I wouldn't have to 
stylize each post in HTML and CSS. This saves me so much time :o

I also wanted separate pages instead of a single-page site to organize the content better. Another cool thing is that 
I decided to host it using GitHub Pages with my custom domain name. This way, every time I push a change to my repo, 
it redeploys the site with my updates. Awesome, right??

Anyway, I really hope you enjoy exploring my website :) If you have any comments, suggestions, or find any evil bugs, send me 
an email (or don't, up to you).
