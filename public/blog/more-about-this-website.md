# more about this website
### june 20, 2024
If you're reading this, you've probably gone through most of my website.

The main reason I decided to create this website was that my previous one was a complete mess. The entire website was built using a single HTML and CSS file (which contained over 1500 lines), and overall was unresponsive and cluttered. While it met my design standards, the codebase felt haphazardly assembled.

So, I decided to start from scratch with a clear vision of what I wanted: minimalist and charming. I had three goals in mind:

(1) I had to include some sort of drawing (by me) and have it animated.

(2) I needed a music player, similar to my old website.

(3) I wanted to add a blog to add some more personality.

Regarding (1), I decided to spend 10 minutes aimlessly drawing with my mouse on Microsoft Paint. The results?
Definitely not Picasso-level, but perfect for small icons, like the frog at the top of the page! I drew 
two versions of each icon to give them that "animated" feel.

For (2), I added a music play/pause feature (similar to my old website) and added a replay button so visitors can
replay the song as many times as they like. The music continues to play no matter what page you're on, so feel free to enjoy
some tunes while reading through my blog.

Finally, for (3), I decided to implement a way to create blog posts using Markdown files, so I wouldn't have to 
stylize each post in HTML and CSS. This saves me so much time :o

I also wanted separate pages instead of a single-page site to organize the content better. Another exciting aspect is
 hosting it on GitHub Pages with my custom domain. This setup redeploys the site with every change pushed to the repository. 
 Awesome, right??

Anyway, I really hope you enjoy exploring my website :) If you have any comments, suggestions, or find any bugs, send me 
an email (or don't, up to you).
