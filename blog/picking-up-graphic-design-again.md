# picking up graphic design again
### december 1, 2024

It's been over three months since my last blog post...

I can't believe it's already December T-T

Anyway, I felt compelled to write something today and give everyone a little update on what I've been up to. I'm still on my co-op term, working as a machine learning engineer intern at Mozilla. It's been a great learning experience and very grateful for the opportunity. Next summer, I'll be joining Asana âˆ´ as a data science intern!

But enough with the career talk â†’ I wanted to share something a bit different this time.

Lately, life's been feeling a bit stagnant, so I decided to pick up graphic design again. By "again", I mean revisiting my hobby during the pandemic. Spending so much time indoors led me to start a basketball Instagram page, where I designed my own graphics featuring stats and fun facts. You can actually still find it [here](https://instagram.com/dunkerdistrict) (but I archived most of the posts a while back and forgot the login information ðŸ’€).

This time, I wanted to start fresh. Instead of sticking to basketball, I let my creative expression take control and decided to create posters about whatever inspires me. Music, movies, random things I find pretty/cool - it's been a lot fo fun exploring this new creative outlet.

So far, I've created 5 posters, but I plan to continue keep making more. You can check out my work [here](https://instagram.com/hhybin), and if you like what you see or have feedback, don't hesitate to reach out and let me know! Also taking requests so don't be shy :)
