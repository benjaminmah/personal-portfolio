1. everything happens for a reason

not every setback is the end of the story. sometimes it feels like my world is falling apart, but those moments shape the larger path. the challenges pushed me toward lessons and places i never would have found otherwise. i don’t always see the reason right away, but i’m starting to trust that there is one.

2. everything will be okay, eventually

life moves in waves. some days feel endless, but time softens even the sharpest edges. i don’t need all the answers right now. i don’t need to fix everything at once. i just need to remember who i am and keep moving forward, even slowly. maybe not tomorrow, or next week, or even next year. but eventually, things do get better.

3. i’m still learning how to love myself

this is the hardest lesson, and one i haven’t finished learning. i’ve spent so much time as my own harshest critic, focusing on what i’m not instead of what i am. now i’m trying to be gentler with myself, the way i am with others. to notice the small wins, forgive the mistakes, and believe i’m enough even when i don’t feel like it. learning to love myself is the most important part of the journey, but not something that happens overnight.
